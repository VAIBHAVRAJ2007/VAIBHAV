            I woke up at 7:00 AM and started my day with studying python. Then I had my breakfast. After that, again I studied python. At 12:00 PM, I took a shower and had lunch at 1:00 PM and then watched cricket and relaxed. In the evening, again I studied python and then I had my dinner at 8:00 PM. After that, I studied Javascript. Again I studied python and watched a movie and finally I studied python before going to bed at 11:00 PM.
